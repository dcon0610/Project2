# Project2: Coffee Rater

## About
This web app is created for BCS Project 2. Known as "Coffee Rater", it is a web site that allows users to upload details about a coffee and give it a rating and review. Other users can give their own ratings and reviews to existing coffee entries, or simply view them. Listed coffees can be filtered by brand name.

This project is in Model-View-Controller format and uses Express, Express-Handlebars, Sequelize, and MySQL. It also makes use of the Cloudinary service for image hosting. The live version is hosted on Heroku and uses a JawsDB database.
